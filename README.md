# BootCamp DOM homework

## Instructions

First install dependencies: `npm install`

Now you are ready to work. Run `npm run start` to start the bundler.

The app now is available on http://localhost:1234/sample.html

## Task

Your task is to create the same HTML tree structure with all attributes on http://localhost:1234/index.html without touching the `index.html` file. You are allowed to use only `index.js` file to create DOM elements!

Use as many different DOM-manipulation methods as possible.

You are not allowed to do innerHTML or similar hacks to make your full HTML structure using HTML string. However, you can use it few times for some smaller pieces.

Feel free to break down your code into functions and separate files to keep the project well-structured.

### BONUS

Add a form handler.

When the form is submitted, replace the form with the message: "You are logged in successfully as {email}" (replace {email} with the email from form)
